  abstract = {In the \textbackslash emph\{budgeted rooted node-weighted Steiner tree\} problem, we are given a graph \$G\$ with \$n\$ nodes, a predefined node \$r\$, two weights associated to each node modelling costs and prizes. The aim is to find a tree in \$G\$ rooted at \$r\$ such that the total cost of its nodes is at most a given budget \$B\$ and the total prize is maximized. In the \textbackslash emph\{quota rooted node-weighted Steiner tree\} problem, we are given a real-valued quota \$Q\$, instead of the budget, and we aim at minimizing the cost of a tree rooted at \$r\$ whose overall prize is at least \$Q\$. For the case of directed graphs with additive prize function, we develop a technique resorting on a standard flow-based linear programming relaxation to compute a tree with good trade-off between prize and cost, which allows us to provide very simple polynomial time approximation algorithms for both the budgeted and the quota problems. For the \textbackslash emph\{budgeted\} problem, our algorithm achieves a bicriteria \$(1+\textbackslash epsilon, O(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\^2\}n\^\{2/3\}\textbackslash ln\{n\}))\$-approximation, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash in (0, 1]\$. For the \textbackslash emph\{quota\} problem, our algorithm guarantees a bicriteria approximation factor of \$(2, O(n\^\{2/3\}\textbackslash ln\{n\}))\$. Next, by using the flow-based LP, we provide a surprisingly simple polynomial time \$O((1+\textbackslash epsilon)\textbackslash sqrt\{n\} \textbackslash ln \{n\})\$-approximation algorithm for the node-weighted version of the directed Steiner tree problem, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$. For the case of undirected graphs with monotone submodular prize functions over subsets of nodes, we provide a polynomial time \$O(\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\^3\}\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}\textbackslash log\{n\})\$-approximation algorithm for the budgeted problem that violates the budget constraint by a factor of at most \$1+\textbackslash epsilon\$, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash in (0, 1]\$. Our technique allows us to provide a good approximation also for the quota problem.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Subgraph extraction is a powerful technique to predict pathways from biological networks and a set of query items (e.g. genes, proteins, compounds, etc.). It can be applied to a variety of different data types, such as gene expression, protein levels, operons or phylogenetic profiles. In this article, we investigate different approaches to extract relevant pathways from metabolic networks. Although these approaches have been adapted to metabolic networks, they are generic enough to be adjusted to other biological networks as well.Results: We comparatively evaluated seven sub-network extraction approaches on 71 known metabolic pathways from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a metabolic network obtained from MetaCyc. The best performing approach is a novel hybrid strategy, which combines a random walk-based reduction of the graph with a shortest paths-based algorithm, and which recovers the reference pathways with an accuracy of {$\sim$}77\%.Availability: Most of the presented algorithms are available as part of the network analysis tool set (NeAT).

Given a graph G=(V,E) on n vertices and a length function on its edges, in the grouped versions of the above mentioned problems we assume that V is partitioned into k+1 groups, \{V0,V1,\ldots,Vk\}, with a penalty function on the groups. In the Group Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem the aim is to find S, a collection of groups of V and a tree spanning the rest of the groups not in S, so as to minimize the sum of the costs of the edges in the tree and the costs of the groups in S. The Group Prize-Collecting Travelling Salesman Problem, is defined analogously. In the Group Location-Routing problem the customer vertices are partitioned into groups and one has to select simultaneously a subset of depots to be opened and a collection of tours that covers the customer groups. The goal is to minimize the costs of the tours plus the fixed costs of the opened depots. We give a (2-1n-1)I-approximation algorithm for each of the three problems, where I is the cardinality of the largest group.},

  abstract = {A first part of the contribution in this thesis consists of approximation algorithms for Minimum Connected Set Cover problem (MCSC) which are published in [28]. First, we present a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm for MCSC problem that uses an approximation algorithm for the group Steiner tree problem (GST) in [37]. We also give a first approximation algorithm for the weighted version of the problem [28]. MCSC problem with demands is also considered. A demand of each element determines the smallest number of sets in the solution that covers considered element. A second part of the contribution is related to the approximation algorithm for GST problem where the size of each group is bounded by some constant. This special cases remains NPhard since it generalizes Steiner tree problem. In the thesis a constant approximation algorithm for this problem will be studied. We also give approximation algorithms for some related problems. A third part of the contribution consists of an adaptation of the algorithm for solving packing and covering linear programs, which is presented in [52], to the parallel computing platform that is supported by modern graphic NVidia chips with CUDA. Instead of updating a single entry in the primal and dual solution vector per iteration, we update a few randomly chosen entries. A part of the contribution is related to deterministic updates of many entries in the primal and dual solution vector which is more amenable for parallelization. Although it increases time per iteration, an update of multiple entries in the primal and dual vectors in one iteration will make the primal and dual vectors converge to the optimal solution much faster which leads to a fewer number of iteration. Approximation algorithms for GST problem use algorithms for solving relaxation of natural integer programming formulation [37] for GST. After integrality constraints are relaxed, a linear program becomes the covering linear program where the number of constraints is an exponential function of the input size. In the thesis, the fully polynomial time approximation scheme from [52, 62] will be adopted such that it approximates a solution of the LP relaxation of GST [51].},

  abstract = {The Group Steiner Tree (GST) problem is a fundamental problem in database area that has been successfully applied to keyword search in relational databases and team search in social networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the GST problem is a parameterized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which finds the optimal tree in O(3kn+2k(n log n + m)) time, where k is the number of given groups, m and n are the number of the edges and nodes of the graph respectively. The major limitations of the parameterized DP algorithm are twofold: (i) it is intractable even for very small values of k (e.g., k=8) in large graphs due to its exponential complexity, and (ii) it cannot generate a solution until the algorithm has completed its entire execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient and progressive GST algorithm in this paper, called PrunedDP. It is based on newly-developed optimal-tree decomposition and conditional tree merging techniques. The proposed algorithm not only drastically reduces the search space of the parameterized DP algorithm, but it also produces progressively-refined feasible solutions during algorithm execution. To further speed up the PrunedDP algorithm, we propose a progressive A*-search algorithm, based on several carefully-designed lower-bounding techniques. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithms on several large scale real-world graphs. The results show that our best algorithm is not only able to generate progressively-refined feasible solutions, but it also finds the optimal solution with at least two orders of magnitude acceleration over the state-of-the-art algorithm, using much less memory.},

Numerous applications of this NP-hard problem initiated researchers to study it from both theoretical and algorithmic aspects. One of the challenges is to provide a good heuristic solution within the reasonable amount of CPU time. We propose the application of metaheuristic framework based on Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and related approaches. One of our main objectives is to find a neighborhood structure that ensures efficient implementation. We develop Variable Neighborhood Descend (VND) algorithm that can be the main ingredient of several local search approaches. Experimental evaluation involves comparison of our heuristic to exact approach based on Integer Linear Programming solvers and other metaheuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed method always outperforms genetic algorithm. Exact method is outperformed in the case of instances with large number of groups.},

  abstract = {The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCSTP) is a well-known generalization of the classic Steiner tree problem in graphs, with a large number of practical applications. It attracted particular interest during the 11th DIMACS Challenge in 2014, and since then, several PCSTP solvers have been introduced in the literature. Although these new solvers further, and often drastically, improved on the results of the DIMACS Challenge, many PCSTP benchmark instances have remained unsolved. The following article describes further advances in the state of the art in exact PCSTP solving. It introduces new techniques and algorithms for PCSTP, involving various new transformations (or reductions) of PCSTP instances to equivalent problems, for example, to decrease the problem size or to obtain a better integer programming formulation. Several of the new techniques and algorithms provably dominate previous approaches. Further theoretical properties of the new components, such as their complexity, are discussed. Also, new complexity results for the exact solution of PCSTP and related problems are described, which form the base of the algorithm design. Finally, the new developments also translate into a strong computational performance: the resulting exact PCSTP solver outperforms all previous approaches, both in terms of runtime and solvability. In particular, it solves several formerly intractable benchmark instances from the 11th DIMACS Challenge to optimality. Moreover, several recently introduced large-scale instances with up to 10 million edges, previously considered to be too large for any exact approach, can now be solved to optimality in less than two hours. Summary of Contribution: The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem (PCSTP) is a well-known generalization of the classic Steiner tree problem in graphs, with many practical applications. The article introduces and analyses new techniques and algorithms for PCSTP that ultimately aim for improved (practical) exact solution. The algorithmic developments are underpinned by results on theoretical aspects, such as fixed-parameter tractability of PCSTP. Computationally, we considerably push the limits of tractibility, being able to solve PCSTP instances with up to 10 million edges. The new solver, which also considerably outperforms the state of the art on smaller instances, will be made publicly available as part of the SCIP Optimization Suite.},

  abstract = {Given an undirected graph and a number of vertex groups, the group Steiner trees problem is to find a tree such that (i) this tree contains at least one vertex in each vertex group; and (ii) the sum of vertex and edge weights in this tree is minimized. Solving this problem is useful in various scenarios, ranging from social networks to knowledge graphs. Most existing work focuses on solving this problem in vertex-unweighted graphs, and not enough work has been done to solve this problem in graphs with both vertex and edge weights. Here, we develop several algorithms to address this issue. Initially, we extend two algorithms from vertex-unweighted graphs to vertex- and edge-weighted graphs. The first one has no approximation guarantee, but often produces good solutions in practice. The second one has an approximation guarantee of |{$\Gamma$}| - 1, where |{$\Gamma$}| is the number of vertex groups. Since the extended (|{$\Gamma$}| - 1)-approximation algorithm is too slow when all vertex groups are large, we develop two new (|{$\Gamma$}| - 1)-approximation algorithms that overcome this weakness. Furthermore, by employing a dynamic programming approach, we develop another (|{$\Gamma$}| - h + 1)-approximation algorithm, where h is a parameter between 2 and |{$\Gamma$}|. Experiments show that, while no algorithm is the best in all cases, our algorithms considerably outperform the state of the art in many scenarios.}

However, even though a large amount of money has been spent on cancer research, some critical information on cancer-related signaling pathways still remains elusive.

It is challenging to reposition drugs as pharmacological data is large and complex. Subnetwork identification has already been used to simplify the visualization and interpretation of biological data, but it has not been applied to drug repositioning so far. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a new Physarum-inspired Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify subnetworks for drug repositioning.},

  abstract = {Consider an edge-weighted graph, and a number of properties of interests (PoIs). Each vertex has a probability of exhibiting each PoI. The joint probability that a set of vertices exhibits a PoI is the probability that this set contains at least one vertex that exhibits this PoI. The probabilistic group Steiner tree problem is to find a tree such that (i) for each PoI, the joint probability that the set of vertices in this tree exhibits this PoI is no smaller than a threshold value, e.g., 0.97; and (ii) the total weight of edges in this tree is the minimum. Solving this problem is useful for mining various graphs with uncertain vertex properties, but is NP-hard. The existing work focuses on certain cases, and cannot perform this task. To meet this challenge, we propose 3 approximation algorithms for solving the above problem. Let |{$\Gamma$}| be the number of PoIs, and {$\xi$} be an upper bound of the number of vertices for satisfying the threshold value of exhibiting each PoI. Algorithms 1 and 2 have tight approximation guarantees proportional to |{$\Gamma$}| and {$\xi$}, and exponential time complexities with respect to {$\xi$} and |{$\Gamma$}|, respectively. In comparison, Algorithm 3 has a looser approximation guarantee proportional to, and a polynomial time complexity with respect to, both |{$\Gamma$}| and {$\xi$}. Experiments on real and large datasets show that the proposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art related work for finding probabilistic group Steiner trees in various cases.}

  abstract = {Given a set of disjoint groups of points in the plane, the rectilinear group Steiner tree problem is the problem of finding a shortest interconnection (under the rectilinear metric) which includes at least one point from each group. This is an important generalization of the well-known rectilinear Steiner tree problem which has direct applications in VLSI design: in the detailed routing phase the logical units typically allow the nets to connect to several electrically equivalent ports. We present a first (tailored) exact algorithm for solving the rectilinear group Steiner tree problem (and related variants of the problem). The algorithm essentially constructs a subgraph of the corresponding Hanan grid on which existing algorithms for solving the Steiner tree problem in graphs are applied. The reductions of the Hanan grid are performed by applying point deletions and by generating full Steiner trees on the remaining points. Experimental results for real-world VLSI instances with up to 100 groups are presented.},
